Files include solutions to the following assignment:

1. Decisions at the Crossroad
Task 1: Code Correction You are provided with a Python script that uses conditional statements to tell if a number is positive, negative, or zero, but it has some errors. Identify and fix them.

Buggy Code:

number = input("Enter a number: ")

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number = 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
else number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
2. The Greatest Showdown
Task 1: Identify the Greatest Write a Python program that asks the user to enter three numbers. Your code should then identify and print out the largest number among the three.

Task 2: Identify the Smallest Improve upon your code from Task 1 to also determine the smallest number among the three and print it out.

Expected Outcome: If we provide the numbers 3, 3, and 4, it should print out that "The smallest number is 3. The largest number is 4. "

3. Leap Year Explorer
Task 1: Leap Year Checker Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a year. The program should determine if the given year is a leap year or not and then display an appropriate message. Please note that this is the definition of a leap year: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

Expected Outcome: If you test the year 1900, is should be False. The year 2000 should be True. The year 2024 should be True
